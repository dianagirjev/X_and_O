# X_and_O

Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. 
It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61970900/200916215-91737171-cdc7-4954-92cf-6e553edac94e.png)
